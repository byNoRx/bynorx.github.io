                The United States of Urania is a fictional country comprised of six states, each governed under its own set 
                of laws. Within its borders lie various cities designed with specific purposes, such as hubs for trade or 
                industry. Its inhabitants, known as Uranians, use the Uranus as the official currency. This nation boasts 
                its own flag and a unique identity that sets it apart.
            </p>

                The economic model of the United States of Urania is capitalist, firmly rooted in absolute respect for 
                democracy. Among its most prominent cities are the City of U.S.U., the nation's capital, and Acorn, 
                the business hub renowned for its towering skyscrapers.

            <h2>States and localities</h2>
            <h3>I. Acorn State</h3>
            <h4>Acorn Kingdom (better known as A.K. City)</h4>
            <p>
                A coastal city hosting the country's largest financial center, including the Acorn Stock Exchange 
                (the most important in the nation). It is home to major companies like the Urania Times newspaper, 
                Acorn Bank, and Urania Bank. It features the most luxurious and expensive properties and is the safest 
                city in the country, housing the largest number of wealthy individuals. A.K. City is a homogeneous area 
                where the middle and upper classes coexist in the same neighborhoods.
            </p>
            <p>
                The city's origin dates back to the ancient Kingdom of Acorn (an area corresponding to the insular part 
                of the city and downtown Nueva Blue), governed by Queen Veronica I. Following the complete extinction 
                of the royal family and as per a signed treaty, the Kingdom of Acorn became the country's fourth state.
            </p>
            <h4>Nueva Blue</h4>
            <p>
                The state capital and its most densely populated city. It has a complex geopolitical history, 
                having been an independent city-state (known as Blue, with Celeste City as its capital) before 
                being annexed due to governmental decline. The city was founded during the monarchy when two of 
                Queen Veronica's daughters were granted territories by the king to establish their own kingdoms 
                in exchange for renouncing their titles and family inheritance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nueva Blue is known for its tax-free policies for businesses, making it the country's tax haven with 
                banking secrecy laws. Residents with their primary domicile in the city also enjoy benefits such as 
                low taxes, making it the second most densely populated and the second most expensive city to live in.
            </p>
            <h4>Rich Valley</h4>
            <p>
                An exclusive locality in the northern part of the state, inhabited only by ultra-wealthy individuals. 
                Property purchases require recommendations and memberships, giving it the reputation of being the least 
                inclusive city in the country.
            </p>
            <h4>Queen’s Garden</h4>
            <p>
                A tranquil and balanced city in terms of socioeconomic levels, designed as a large garden and hosting 
                the country's greatest variety of vegetation.
            </p>
            <h4>Santa Elisa</h4>
            <p>Under construction.</p>
