        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
          The United States of Urania is a fictional country comprised of seven
          states, each governed under its own set of laws. Within its borders
          lie various cities designed with specific purposes, such as hubs for
          trade or industry. Its inhabitants, known as Uranians, use the Uranus
          as the official currency. This nation boasts its own flag and a unique
          identity that sets it apart.
        </p>

        <p>
          The economic model of the United States of Urania is capitalist,
          firmly rooted in absolute respect for democracy. Among its most
          prominent cities are the City of U.S.U., the nation's capital, and
          Acorn, the business hub renowned for its towering skyscrapers.
