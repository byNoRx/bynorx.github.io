            The <b>United States of Urania</b> consists of a Minecraft pocket edition 
            project developed since 2014 that is still in progress. The United States 
            of Urania is a fictional country made up of 6 states. Each one of them, 
            governed by their own laws, where there are various cities that fulfill 
            some purpose. Its inhabitants identify themselves as Uranians, the country's 
            currency is the Uranus. The country has its own flag and in general a unique 
            identity. The country's economic model is based on a capitalist economy, 
            where democracy is respected above all else. The most important cities 
            are the city of U.S.U; capital of the country and Acorn, the business 
            center with large skyscrapers. You can enjoy an extensive map, with 
            unique architecture and inspired by current modernity, even using extensions 
            you will be able to enjoy the map in a better way, traveling through 
            well-connected roads, cities, hidden places, etc. The size of the map is huge, 
            that explains the great weight of the file. It is not a map suitable for everyone, 
            low visibility could guarantee better performance.
